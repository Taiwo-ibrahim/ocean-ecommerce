              <p>
                We strive to use the original packaging provided by brands

                <br /> Display items may not always include original packaging,
                but we ensure that all items are carefully packed to avoid
                damage during shipping.

              <h4>9. What is the return and/or refund process?</h4>

                Returns: Items must be returned in new, unused condition within
                14 days of the original shipment. Please include a copy of the
                order confirmation email.
                <br /> Refund Process: Shipping and handling fees from the
                original purchase are not eligible for refunds. Customers are
                responsible for return shipping charges. Refunds will be issued
                to the original form of payment used for the purchase. <br />
                Important Notes: Sale items are not eligible for refunds or
                store credits. Returned items must be in perfect condition with

                show signs of wear or have been altered from their original
                condition. In such cases, we may reduce the amount of any refund
                or exchange.

              <p>
                While we strive to prevent delays, there may be occasional
                delays due to several factors, such as:
                <br /> Shipping Address Issues: If your shipping address differs
                from your billing address, we may verify the order for security
                reasons to protect you.
                <br />
                Backordered Items: Some products may be on backorder, requiring
                additional time for shipment.
                <br /> Incomplete Information: International orders placed with
                incomplete shipping and/or billing details may experience
                delays.
                <br /> Our team will notify you in case of any significant
                delays, and we appreciate your patience during such instances.
